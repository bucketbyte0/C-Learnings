# C-Learnings

Welcome to my **C-Learnings** repository! This repo contains various small projects that I build while learning the C programming language. The goal of this repository is to showcase my progress in learning C and to keep track of my projects.

## Projects

Each folder and file in this repository corresponds to a small project or a learning exercise in C programming. These projects help me understand the core concepts and fundamentals of C.

### Current Projects:
- **Calculator**: A basic command-line calculator that performs simple operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **[Additional Projects]**: As I continue to learn, I'll add more small projects here.

## How to Use the Projects

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the command:
   ```bash
   git@github.com:bucketbyte0/C-Learnings.git
